# Simple shell project


# This is a team of two project: NIYOKWIZERWA Jean Paul Elisa(Ndevu) & Jackline NYANGANJOKI

We did this while we are about to finish first spring in ALX SE program


# This Simple shell will mimic some shell functionalities


# Here are what it will be doing:


1. Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
2. The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
3. The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
4. The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
5. If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
6. You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
7. Handle command lines with arguments
8. Simple shell 0.2 +

Handle the PATH
fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist
9. Simple shell 0.3 +

Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
Usage: exit
You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

10. Simple shell 0.4 +

Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
11. Simple shell 0.1 +

Write your own getline function
Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
You will need to use static variables
You are not allowed to use getline
12. handle arguments for the built-in exit
